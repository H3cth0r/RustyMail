**Purpose**: This function manages the entire interaction with an SMTP client, 
from receiving the initial connection to processing commands and sending responses.

```
pub fn handle(reader: &mut dyn BufRead, writer: &mut dyn Write) -> Result<Connection, Error> {
    // 1. Initialization:
    let mut result = Connection::new();         // Create a new Connection instance.
    writeln!(writer, "{}", MSG_READY)?;      // Send the initial "220 ready" message to the client.

    // 2. Main Loop (Command Processing):
    loop {
        // a. Read from Client:
        let mut line = String::new();             // Create an empty string to store the client's command.
        reader.read_line(&mut line)?;          // Read a line of input from the client.

        // b. Process the Command:
        match result.feed_line(line.trim_right_matches(|c: char| c == '\n' || c == '\r')) { 
            // Process the received command, removing trailing whitespace/newlines.

            Ok("") => {}, // If the command processing returns Ok(""), it's a silent success, do nothing.

            Ok(s) => {  // If processing is successful and returns a string 's':
                writeln!(writer, "{}", s)?; // Send the response string 's' back to the client.
                if s.starts_with("221") {  // Check if the response starts with "221" (means "QUIT" was processed).
                    break; // Exit the loop if "QUIT" was received.
                }
            }

            Err(e) => { 
                writeln!(writer, "{}", e)?; // If there's an error, send the error message to the client.
            }
        } 
    }

    Ok(result) // Return the Connection object, now potentially holding processed messages.
}
```

**Purpose**: This is a helper function to safely access data within the Connection object 
only if the connection is in the Done state.
```
fn get_if_done<R, F: FnOnce() -> R>(&self, getter: F) -> Option<R> {
    match self.state {
        State::Done => Some(getter()), // If in the "Done" state, call the provided getter function and return Some(result).
        _ => None,                    // If in any other state, return None (don't call the getter).
    }
}
```
